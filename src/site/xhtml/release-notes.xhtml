    <h1>Release Notes</h1>

    <p>This code is supplied as-is and without warranty or any assertion of
    fitness for purpose (either by the author or his employer, original or
    current).
    It is as good as the test-pack it is delivered with.
    It is made available for use by any member of FIX Protocol Limited in
    good standing.</p>

    <p>This code was originally written as a part of an integration project.
    The author and his employer (at that time) agreed that publishing this
    code would be beneficial for the FIX standard, and everyone using it.
    It was agreed that the code would be in no-way attributed to or endorsed
    by the employer.</p>

    <p>The author recognises and acknowledges the assistance of Jim Northey
    in clarifying aspects of FIX and the Unified FIX Repository, thus allowing
    this code to be created.</p>

    <p>FixConv was written and is maintained by Andy Key,
    andy.z.key@googlemail.com</p>.
